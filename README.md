# DataAnalysis
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This analysis contains just one script named run_analyis.R.
The script:
- reads data from several files
- check if there are missing data
- combines data from the several files
- extracts measures containing std or mean in their names
- gives all columns understandable names
- creates a new data set grouping the data per Acivity and Subject and calculates the average of the measures
- creates a file my_mean_df.txt holding the new data set
 
See the codebook for details about the variables
